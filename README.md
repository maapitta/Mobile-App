# Mobile-App
This repository showcases a collection of mobile app projects developed by me during my journey as a beginner in mobile app development using Kotlin and Android Studio. It serves as a portfolio of my projects, including assignments and coursework completed during my time in college.

Each project folder in this repository contains a dedicated README.md file that provides essential information and instructions for using the respective mobile app. These README.md files explain the purpose of the app, its features, and how to set up and run the project on an Android device or emulator.

Feel free to explore the different mobile app projects and their corresponding README.md files to see the progression of my skills and knowledge in Android development.
